Lets Start with creating a Custom Scrapy project:
Creating a scrapy project:



# (Remember open cmd or terminal in the relevant folder)
scrapy startproject redditPosts



# For now, the two most important files are:

### settings.py – This file contains the settings you set for your project, you’ll be dealing a lot with it.
### spiders/ – This folder is where all your custom spiders will be stored. Every time you ask scrapy to run a spider, it will look for it in this folder.



Creating a spider
Let’s change directory into our first scraper and create a basic spider “redditbot” :

scrapy genspider redditbot www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones/


This will create a new spider “redditbot.py” in your spiders/ folder.
